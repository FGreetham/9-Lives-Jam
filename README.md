2nd Game Jam entry: Get the cat across the street in the time given

With a theme of "every life counts", I spent 4 days working on this entry whereby the player controls a cat and has to get across the city pipes in the alloted time. 

I created a timer, spawn points and life counter for my 2nd game jam entry as a way to discover what I have learnt so far.

An area for improvement would be movement controls - I set it up as tank controls and I think this mini-game could be vastly enhanced by changing this.
